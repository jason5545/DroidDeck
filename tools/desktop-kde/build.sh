# Builds the KDE Plasma desktop package for the Linux runtime: the closure of seeds.txt over Arch
# Linux ARM's aarch64 repositories, minus what the runtime image already carries, plus overlay/,
# as a zstd tarball that extracts over the rootfs (DesktopCatalog's "tar" kind).
#
#   tools/desktop-kde/build.sh <out dir>
#
# The runtime's own packages (runtime-packages.txt, "name version" from its pacman db) are not
# shipped again, except where something in the closure asks for a version of one the runtime does
# not have (a versioned dependency on it, or on a library it provides): then the repository's
# build comes along and replaces it. Nothing is deleted on extraction, so a library whose soname
# moved keeps its old file for what the runtime linked against it.
#
# Every package is fetched over HTTPS and must carry a valid signature by the Arch Linux ARM Build
# System key (archlinuxarm-builder.gpg; primary fingerprint pinned below, as archlinuxarm.org
# publishes it and archlinuxarm-keyring trusts it) and match the sha256 the repository database
# gives for it; anything else stops the build. The repository databases themselves are not signed
# by Arch Linux ARM, so they decide only which signed packages are taken. desktop-kde.packages.txt
# lists every package taken, with its sha256: what a release was built from.
#
# Needs curl, gpgv, tar, xz, zstd, python3.
