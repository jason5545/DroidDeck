/**
 * What happens around a store install so the rest of the app sees the game: the sidecar is
 * written, the launcher .bat beside it when the game needs one, and Steam is told.
 *
 * Telling Steam is the same path an added folder takes: the game is one more folder the
 * [AddedGames] scan finds, the scan's listing (`session/added-games.json`) is what the runtime's
 * shortcuts writer reads at the client's next start, and here the listing is rewritten at once so
 * a Steam client that restarts inside the running session already has it. When the client is up,
 * [SteamLiveShortcuts] adds the shortcut over the client's DevTools port as well, so the game shows
 * without a restart; that part is best-effort.
