/**
 * Finishes a session's folder: the compositor's log, the Steam client's logs scrubbed line by
 * line, Android's crash buffer, and a marker that says the folder is complete.
 *
 * Three callers, because a session ends three ways. [collect] runs at an ordinary stop. The
 * app's uncaught-exception handler ([CrashHandler]) runs it as the process dies, so a crash in
 * our own code leaves a full folder and not a half one. And [finishAbandoned] runs at the next
 * app start for a folder that has no marker: the process was killed outright (Android's phantom
 * process killer, a native crash in the compositor, the battery) and nothing of ours got to run.
 * Everything written *during* the session - session.log, app.log, wayland.log, audio.log, the
 * device report - is already on disk at that point; only the pieces gathered at the end were
 * missing, and the crash buffer keeps its entries after the process is gone, which is the whole
 * reason it is worth coming back for.
